Project 78: Job Fair CV Tally By MUTONI SANDRINE

In the project I was given about:

1. Integers:

I started with a list of integers representing the number of CVs collected from different booths at a job fair.

I calculated key Operations:

Total CVs collected by adding all values.

Average CVs per booth by dividing the total by the number of booths.

Minimum and maximum CVs to understand the range of data.

2. Strings:

Using Python’s f-strings, I created a summary string.

This report cleary shows the totals and averages that was calcurated earlier.

3. Booleans:

I defined a threshold for the average number of CVs (40 in this case).

Applied a compound boolean condition:

The average CVs must exceed the threshold AND at least one booth must have more than 60 CVs.

Based on this condition, the program printed a status message:

"Above Standard" if conditions met.

"Below Standard" if conditions are not met.

4. Lists:

A list of booth names was made corresponding to the CV data.

I made list operations:

Adding a new booth with append().

Removing booths based on a condition (e.g., booth names ending with “D”).

Sorting the list alphabetically with sort().

5. Arrays: 

I stored a fixed-size subset of CV counts, using Python’s array module.

and calculated the sum of this array and compared it to the sum of the same slice from the original list.

It shows equivalency in calculations between arrays and lists.

6. Dictionaries:

I created a list of dictionaries each representing a booth record with fields:

id (unique identifier),

name (booth name),

value (number of CVs).

Dictionary operations:

Updating the CV count for a specific booth (e.g., Booth C).

Deleting a record (Booth D).

Calculated the total CVs after updates to relate to current data.
